# SpeakUp-BCI Architecture

SpeakUp-BCI is a software that utilizes brain-computer interfaces to allow individuals with severe motor disabilities to communicate by translating their brain signals into text or speech. The software consists of the following components:

## User Interface

The User Interface is responsible for displaying information to the user and receiving input from the user. The interface includes a text box for displaying text output and a microphone button for speech output. The user can also input text using an on-screen keyboard or via a connected keyboard.

## Brain-Computer Interface

The Brain-Computer Interface component is responsible for acquiring and processing the user's brain signals. The interface includes a set of electrodes that are placed on the user's scalp to measure brain activity. The signals are processed to extract relevant information and then translated into text or speech output.

## Speech Synthesis

The Speech Synthesis component is responsible for generating speech output from text input. The component includes a text-to-speech engine that converts text into speech using pre-recorded or synthesized speech.

## Configuration and Settings

The Configuration and Settings component is responsible for managing user preferences and settings. The component includes a settings file that stores user preferences for things like electrode placement, speech settings, and user interface themes.
